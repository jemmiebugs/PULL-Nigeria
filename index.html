        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>“Education is fundamental to sustainable development, it is a powerful driver of development and one of the strongest instruments for reducing poverty and improving health; it enables people to be more productive, to earn a better living and enjoy a better quality of life, while also contributing to a country’s overall economic growth.”</p>

        <h2>Women Empowerment</h2>
        <p>A tailor-made strategy called the ‘4 S Model’ has been developed for women empowerment. The ‘4 S Model’ is an acronym for four novel approaches, namely Seeking Healthcare as a Behaviour, Support for Education, Supporters through Male Involvement, and Sustaining the Change in Communities.

          The programme identifies adolescent girls and women from the community and develops them into Change Agents, who in turn actively contribute to the community mobilization process.
          
          So far, this model has successfully made a difference to the lives of over 500,000 women and girl children.</p>

            <p class="text-black">P.U.L.L Nigeria is an NGO in Nigeria directly benefitting over 500,000 children and their families every year, through more than 150 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 1000 remote villages and slums across 36 states of Nigeria.</p>
            <p class="text-black">Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to 
              earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social 
              behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.</p>
              <p class="text-black">Doubtless, education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. But child education cannot be done in isolation. A child will go to school only if the family, particularly the mother, is assured of healthcare and empowered. Moreover, when an elder 
                sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins earning, the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation.</p>
                  <p class="text-black">Realizing this, P.U.L.L Nigeria an NGO in Nigeria, beginning in the corridors of education, 
                    adopted a lifecycle approach of development, focusing its interventions on children, their families and the larger community.</p>
                    <p class="text-black">P.U.L.L Nigeria believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the process of 
                      development, sustainable change will not happen. Following this model of Civic Driven Change, 
                      P.U.L.L Nigeria sensitizes and engages the civil society, making it an active partner in all its welfare initiatives.</p>

              <p>Children are the future of a nation. For an emerging country like Nigeria, development of underprivileged children holds the key to the progress of the nation itself, and their education is the cornerstone of this progress. But education for children cannot be achieved without ensuring the welfare of the family – a child can go to school regularly only when the family, particularly the mother is healthy and empowered; the family has decent livelihood opportunities and a steady income.
                Realizing this, P.U.L.L Nigeria, beginning in the corridors of education, has adopted a lifecycle approach with intensive programmes focused on family health, livelihood and community engagement through women empowerment, which addresses the needs of less privileged children, their families and the larger community.

              poverty, population control, unemployment or human rights, there's no better place to start than in the corridors of education. </p>
             <p class="mb-5">P.U.L.L Nigeria’s educational initiatives include Pre-school [3-6 yrs], Non Formal Education [6-14 yrs non-school going, 
               Remedial Education [6-14 yrs school going] and Bridge Course [14-18 yrs drop-outs]. It works for education for underprivileged children who are under difficult circumstances, such as child labour, children of poorest of the parents, children inflicted and affected with HIV/AIDS, street and runaway children, children with rare disabilities, disaster struck children and slum children. 
               Special emphasis is given on girl education and women education, so that they and their families get empowered.  </p> 
               <p class="mb-5">Since its inception in 2010, more than 50,000 underprivileged children 
                 have directly benefitted from the Mission Education programme. </p>

            <p class="mb-5">The youth comprises over one-third of the Nigeria population which in turn constitutes a major part of the labour force of the country. The number of underprivileged youth in Nigeria who lacks education and proper guidance is so huge that according to the reports of the 
              Financial Express only 15% of the young graduates passing out of universities are employable; the rest are branded unemployable.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">It is not their lack of theoretical knowledge that causes this. Instead, it is the lack of right skills and attitude. There is thus, an increasing concern among the leading employers of the country, about the dearth of ready-to-deliver employees. In addition, the macro perspective affirms that, it is crucial for the energy of the underprivileged youth to be channelized properly with proper 
              direction to aid economic growth and nation building to elude their addition to family woes, social stress and national misery.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">Life After School E- learning Programme (LASEP) is such an initiative of the P.U. L. L Nigeria that aims at creating a

                This national level programme trains the urban underprivileged youth in English Proficiency, Basic Computer Education and Soft Skills for enhancing their prospects of employment in the fast expanding retail, hospitality and BPO sectors.
                </p>
            <p class="mb-5">So far, more than 2,600 youth have been trained and 1,500

        <p class="mb-5">Children are the future of a nation. They are the best change agents, be it in the family or the community in which they live. It is therefore crucial to help the children, catch them young and inculcate in them feelings of empathy and conscience so that they grow up as responsible individuals. Sensing this need, P.U.L.L Nigeria came up with Child For Child (CFC) programme in 2017. Sensitization
           of privileged children and their parents, towards the existing inequalities around them, is an important objective of CFC.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">Privileged children are sensitized about the deprivation and pain endured by the underprivileged kids. CFC seeks to inculcate a conscience and value system in the children so that they grow up to become responsible citizens and change makers. Before their minds are set with age, the CFC programme tries to make them count their own blessings and understand the plight of less privileged ones. Once they start realizing the worth of the privileges they are born with, they automatically turn their thoughts towards positivity and develop the right outlook. This eventually helps them develop into not only successful 
          but responsible individuals in life. They grow up to become significant change makers, who contribute positively to the society.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">Under Child For Child programme, P.U.L.L Nigeria visits various schools and conducts engaging sessions for the young minds.
           It sensitizes children towards various causes and let them realize their privileged status.</p>

Armed with this set of skills Aderonke landed a job as Computer Operator and sales person at a well known Super Mart.
                    Aderonke now helps her father in managing the household and providing for her sisters education. And is thankful to LASEP for infusing confidence and zeal to work hard, in her.

Staying with her parents and three younger siblings in Oyo, poverty and struggle have been a part of her life since childhood. But Omowunmi has fought her circumstances with grit and determination and has emerged a winner.
                    Upon a friend's suggestion she joined LASEP which completely changed her life. She soon landed a job and owned a shop after completing her six month course and now supports her family with her earnings.
